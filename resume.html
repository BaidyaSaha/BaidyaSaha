                            I have designed this website completely by hand coding. The layout formation is done based on the concept
                            called <i>one-page design</i>. This design style is becoming popular since the entire web page is loaded at
                            one time and the user can browse through the page using within page link up. To make the website more easy to
                            view the <i>fixed header</i> approach is used. In this way, the user always sees the main links fixed at
                            upper or side parts of the web page and the rest of the contents can be accessed by scrolling through them.
                            Although this <i>one page design</i> may not be applicable in all the areas, especially when the web page requires
                            to redirect to different other sites. But, in general, this is a good design approach and makes the coding part
                            more easy, with less number of files to maintain.

                       <p class="content"> 
                            To design the layout and style of the website I have used
                            <a onclick="target='_blank'" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">Cascaded Style Sheet (CSS)</a>.
                            If you are new to CSS, then at the very beginning, you should be aware of the following two approaches
                            to designing the layout of web pages:
                       </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Conventional Approach : Using tables for layout, and entering content in the table cells.</li>
                                <li>The New Approach : Using <i>div</i> and, <i>id</i> and <i>class</i>'s under <i>div</i>, to design
                                layout and content positioning using CSS.</li>
                            </ul>
                      
                        <p class="content"> 
                            There are several reasons for opting for a CSS based layout. There are plenty of tutorials talking about them
                            but here's what I feel the most important ones are:
                        </p>
                            <ul> 
                                <li><span class="sp">Separating content from presentation</span>: This design technique makes the code
                                much more coherent and easier to manage. Consider having a 100 page website laid using tables.
                                If you have to change the <i>span</i> in one table cell or the table layout itself, you would have to do that for all
                                the 100 pages separately. Whereas, using CSS, this can be done by simply changing a single CSS file.
                                </li>
                                <li><span class="sp">Lesser download time</span>: Once the CSS file is downloaded, (about few <i>KB</i>),
                                all the pages use the same presentation information from it, so a huge saving in download time is achieved.
                                </li>
                                <li><span class="sp">Varying capabilities of user-agents</span>: Browsers on Computers are not the only
                                way by which content is accessed. Mobile handsets and TVs etc are some other devices where complex table layouts
                                may fail miserably. With CSS, we may apply the styles to only certain types of user-agents,
                                allowing graceful degradation for other types of agents or also change the layout design dynamically.
                                </li>
                           </ul>
                       
                        <p class="content">
                           This site in particular uses an <i>fixed</i> positioned <i>div</i> for the menu system on the upper part of the screen
                           as a <i>fixed header</i>. Rest of the contains can be scrolled through or viewed by clicking on the menu items.
